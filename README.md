# TicTacToe

Use Python's Tkinter Library (GUI) to create a tictactoe game. The game allows users to play with a friend, reset when they finish, 
keep's track of the proper player's turn and display a welcome and game over message.

The applicaton is still under development:

To do:
- Finish basic stying
- Clean code (creation of buttons, etc...)

What I learnt:

- Using an object oriented approach to build small tknter applications
- Practice OOP, and python skills
- Practice tkinter syntax
- Having fun with programming :)

What next?
  After finishing this project, I will work on a new applicaton that combines libries such as tkinter and scipy.
